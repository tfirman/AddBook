#### _A web server that creates an address book from user input_

#### By _**Tim Firman**_

## Description

_This is a C# Application that operates a local website that takes input from the user to create an address book.  The user is asked for a name, a phone number, and an address for each entry.  The user can delete the entire list.  The user can also click on an individual entry to see detailed information and is there presented with the option to delete an individual entry._

## Specifications

* Program outputs

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_This software is a C# web server, and would need to have a "dotnet restore" to the root directory followed by execution using dotnet run._

## Known Bugs

Though the server does successfully delete individual entries when the delete this entry button is pressed on the detail screen, there is an error in rendering the page thereafter.  The functionality of the deletion does work, as can be seen if the user manually goes back to the root page.  As this was an optional feature anyhow it has been left in to demonstrate the partial functionality.

## Technologies Used
